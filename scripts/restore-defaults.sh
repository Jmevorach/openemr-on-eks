# OpenEMR Deployment Files Default State Restoration Script
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Restores all deployment files to their default Git HEAD state, removing
#   deployment artifacts, backup files, and generated credentials. Designed
#   to clean up the repository for fresh deployments or git operations.
#
# Key Features:
#   - Restores Kubernetes YAML files to default template state
#   - Removes backup files (.bak) created during deployment
#   - Cleans up generated credentials and temporary files
#   - Provides safety confirmations and backup options
#   - Preserves user configuration files (terraform.tfvars)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Git repository with clean working tree (for safety)
#
# Usage:
#   ./restore-defaults.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   --force    Skip confirmation prompts
#   --help     Show this help message
#
# Notes:
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This script will ERASE any structural changes to YAML files.
#   Only use for cleaning up deployment artifacts, NOT during active development.
#   Always commit your changes before running this script.
#
# Examples:
#   ./restore-defaults.sh
#   ./restore-defaults.sh --force
#
