# OpenEMR EKS CI/CD Test Suite Workflow
# =====================================
# This workflow provides comprehensive testing and validation for the OpenEMR EKS deployment
# across multiple dimensions including code quality, Kubernetes manifests, script validation,
# and documentation. It runs automatically on pushes and pull requests, and can be manually
# triggered with specific test suite selection.
#
# Key Features:
# - Multi-dimensional testing (code quality, K8s manifests, scripts, documentation)
# - Matrix strategy for parallel test execution across different test suites
# - Comprehensive environment setup (Python, Terraform, kubectl, shellcheck)
# - Security scanning with Trivy vulnerability scanner
# - Artifact collection and test result reporting
# - Manual workflow dispatch with test suite selection
#
# Test Categories:
# 1. Code Quality: Shell script syntax validation, common issue detection
# 2. Kubernetes Manifests: YAML syntax validation, K8s best practices
# 3. Script Validation: Shell script analysis with shellcheck
# 4. Documentation: Markdown validation and structure checks
# 5. Security Scan: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy (secrets, config, vulns)
