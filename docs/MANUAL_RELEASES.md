This document describes the manual release system for the OpenEMR on EKS project, which provides controlled version bumping and release management through GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Overview

The manual release system manages project versions and creates GitHub releases based on:
- **Manual triggers only**: All releases are manually initiated through GitHub Actions
- **Full control**: You decide when and what type of release to create
- **Flexible timing**: No automatic schedules, releases happen when you want them

## üìÖ Release Schedule

### Manual Releases Only

| Trigger | Version Bump | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Manual** | `major`, `minor`, or `patch` | On-demand releases triggered by you |

**Note**: There are no automatic scheduled releases. All releases must be manually triggered.

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Release Type Determination

The workflow determines the release type based on your manual input:

```yaml
# Manual trigger only
case "${{ github.event.inputs.release_type }}" in
  "major")
    bump-version="major"   # Breaking changes
    ;;
  "minor")
    bump-version="minor"   # New features
    ;;
  "patch")
    bump-version="patch"   # Bug fixes
    ;;
esac
```

### 2. Change Detection

Before creating a release, the system checks if there are actual changes since the last release:

```bash
# Get the last release tag
LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "")

# Check if there are commits since last tag
if [[ -z "$LAST_TAG" ]]; then
  echo "No previous tags found. This will be the first release."
  has-changes=true
elif git log --oneline "$LAST_TAG..HEAD" | grep -q .; then
  echo "Changes detected since last release, proceeding"
  has-changes=true
else
  echo "No changes since last release, skipping"
  has-changes=false
fi
```

### 3. Version Bumping

The system automatically calculates and updates the new version using the Python `semver` library:

```python
import semver

current = semver.Version.parse(os.environ["CURRENT"])
bump_type = os.environ["BUMP"]

if bump_type == "major":
    new = current.bump_major()      # 1.0.0 (resets minor and patch to 0)
elif bump_type == "minor":
    new = current.bump_minor()      # 0.2.0 (resets patch to 0)
else:  # patch
    new = current.bump_patch()      # 0.1.1 (increments patch only)
```

**Version Reset Rules:**
- **Major bump** (`1.0.0`): Resets both minor and patch to `0`
- **Minor bump** (`0.1.0`): Resets patch to `0`
- **Patch bump** (`0.0.1`): Only increments patch number

### 4. File Updates

Version information is updated in the primary version file:

- `VERSION` - Primary version file (automatically updated)

### 5. Release Creation

The system creates:
- Git tag with the new version
- GitHub release with comprehensive release notes
- Commit with version bump and metadata
- Detailed release notes including commit history and statistics

## üìã Manual Release Process

### Triggering a Manual Release

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **Manual Releases** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose your release type:
   - **Major**: For breaking changes
   - **Minor**: For new features
   - **Patch**: For bug fixes
5. **Required**: Add release notes describing the changes
6. (Optional) Enable dry run for testing
7. Click **Run workflow**

### Manual Release Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `release_type` | Type of version bump | `major`, `minor`, `patch` |
| `release_notes` | **Required** release notes | "Added new ML features and resolved EFS mounting issues" |
| `dry_run` | Test without creating release | `true`/`false` |

**Important**: Release notes are now **required** for all manual releases to ensure proper documentation of changes.

## üîç Release Notes Generation

### Automatic Release Notes

The system automatically generates comprehensive release notes by combining your required input with commit information:

```markdown
## Release v0.2.0

**Release Type:** Minor
**Triggered By:** @username
**Date:** 2024-01-01 15:30:00 UTC

### Release Notes
Added new ML features and resolved EFS mounting issues

### Changes
- abc1234: feat: Added ML stack installation script
- def5678: fix: Resolved EFS mounting issues
- ghi9012: docs: Updated deployment guide

### Statistics
- Commits: 3
- Contributors: 2
- Files changed: 15 files changed, 234 insertions(+), 45 deletions(-)
```

### Required Release Notes Integration

Your required release notes are prominently displayed and integrated into the final release:

- **Top-Level Display**: Your notes appear prominently at the top of the release
- **Commit Integration**: Combined with automatic commit-based change detection
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures both human context and technical details are captured
- **Quality Assurance**: Required notes prevent releases without proper documentation

### Custom Release Notes

Release notes are **required** for all manual releases and will be prominently displayed in the release description. This ensures:

- **Proper Documentation**: Every release has meaningful context
- **Change Tracking**: Clear record of what was included in each release
- **Team Communication**: Better understanding of release contents
- **Compliance**: Proper documentation for audit and review purposes

### User Tracking

Every release includes comprehensive tracking of who triggered it:

- **GitHub Username**: The `@username` of the person who triggered the release
- **Workflow Run**: Direct link to the GitHub Actions run that created the release
- **Git Commit**: The version bump commit includes who triggered it
- **Git Tag**: The release tag includes trigger information and timestamp
- **Release Notes**: All release metadata includes the trigger source

This provides complete auditability and accountability for all releases.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Status

Monitor release status in the GitHub Actions tab:
- `‚úÖ Release completed successfully`: Release successful
- `‚ùå Release failed`: Release failed
- `‚è≠Ô∏è No changes detected, release skipped`: No changes detected
- `üîç Dry run completed`: Dry run mode completed successfully

### Logs

Detailed logs are available for each job:
- Click on the workflow run
- Expand individual job steps
- View console output for debugging
- Check workflow summary for overview

### Common Issues

#### No Changes Detected
- **Cause**: No commits since last release tag
- **Solution**: Make changes and commit them before manually initiating a release

#### Version File Not Found
- **Cause**: Missing VERSION file
- **Solution**: Ensure VERSION file exists in repository root

#### Permission Errors
- **Cause**: Insufficient repository permissions
- **Solution**: Ensure workflow has write access to repository

#### Invalid Version Format
- **Cause**: VERSION file contains invalid semantic version
- **Solution**: Ensure VERSION file contains valid format (e.g., "1.0.0")

## üöÄ Best Practices

### 1. Version Management
- Keep the `VERSION` file in the repository root
- Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Ensure VERSION file contains valid semantic version format

### 2. Release Notes
- Write clear, descriptive release notes
- Include context about what changed and why
- Reference related issues or pull requests when applicable

### 3. Testing
- Use dry run mode for testing release process
- Test with different release types
- Verify version file updates
- Test change detection logic

### 4. Monitoring
- Regularly check workflow execution
- Monitor release creation
- Review generated release notes
- Check workflow summaries for insights

### 5. Release Planning
- Plan releases based on feature completion
- Coordinate releases with team schedules
- Use major releases sparingly for breaking changes
- Consider impact on downstream consumers
