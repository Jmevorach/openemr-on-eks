## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Accurate Timing Expectations

1. **Always add 25-50% buffer** for production planning
2. **Test in your target region** - timings vary by location
3. **Measure during peak hours** to understand worst-case scenarios
4. **Account for retries** in automation scripts
5. **Monitor trends over time** to detect performance degradation

### For Troubleshooting Slow Operations

**If deployment takes > 20 minutes longer than expected:**
1. Check AWS Service Health Dashboard
2. Review CloudWatch logs for errors
3. Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
4. Verify image pull times
5. Check resource quotas and limits

**If restore takes > 50 minutes:**
1. Check RDS instance deletion timing (should be ~11-13 min)
2. Check RDS cluster restore timing (should be ~11-13 min)
3. Check EFS wipe job completion (should complete in <5 min)
4. Verify crypto key cleanup and pod restart (should be ~40 sec)
5. Review verification retry attempts (max 3 attempts of 5 min each)
