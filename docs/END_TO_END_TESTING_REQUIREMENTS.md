# End-to-End Testing Requirements

## üîí **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**

**Before any changes are made to the OpenEMR on EKS repository, the end-to-end backup/restore test script MUST pass successfully.** This is a core requirement that ensures disaster recovery capabilities remain intact.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è AWS Resource Warning**: The end-to-end test script (`scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh`) will create and delete resources in AWS, including backup buckets and RDS snapshots created as part of other tests that may not have finished. As a result, it should only be run in a development AWS account and **NOT** in an AWS account that runs production workloads.

## üéØ Overview

The end-to-end backup/restore test validates the complete disaster recovery process by:

1. **Creating infrastructure from scratch**
2. **Deploying OpenEMR application**
3. **Creating test data for verification**
4. **Performing complete backup**
5. **Testing monitoring stack installation and uninstallation**
6. **Destroying all infrastructure**
7. **Recreating infrastructure**
8. **Restoring from backup**
9. **Verifying data integrity and connectivity**
10. **Cleaning up all test resources**

This comprehensive test ensures that any changes to the repository don't break the core disaster recovery capabilities.

## üö® Why This Is Critical

### **Disaster Recovery**

- **Patient Data Protection**: Ensures healthcare data can be recovered in disaster scenarios
- **Business Continuity**: Validates that the system can be restored and operational
- **Compliance Requirements**: Demonstrates disaster recovery capabilities for audits

### **Infrastructure Validation**

- **Terraform Configurations**: Ensures infrastructure as code works correctly
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Validates application deployment configurations
- **Resource Dependencies**: Confirms all AWS resources are properly configured

### **Regression Prevention**

- **Change Impact Assessment**: Identifies if modifications break existing functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Validates that all components work together correctly
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures changes meet production standards

### **Compliance and Auditing**

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Demonstrates data protection capabilities for healthcare applications
- **Audit Trail**: Provides evidence of disaster recovery testing
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces risk of data loss or system failure

## üîÑ Testing Process

### **Running the Test**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/openemr-on-eks

# Run the complete end-to-end test
./scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh --cluster-name openemr-eks-test

# Custom test configuration
./scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh \
  --cluster-name openemr-eks-test \
  --aws-region us-west-2 \
  --namespace openemr
```

### **Test Steps Details**

| Step | Description | Success Criteria |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **1. Infrastructure Deployment** | Creates complete EKS cluster | Cluster is accessible and healthy |
| **2. OpenEMR Installation** | Deploys OpenEMR application | Application is running and accessible |
| **3. Test Data Creation** | Creates timestamped proof.txt | File exists with correct content |
| **4. Backup Creation** | Runs complete backup process | Backup is created successfully |
| **5. Monitoring Stack Test** | Installs and uninstalls monitoring stack | Monitoring components work correctly |
| **6. Infrastructure Destruction** | Removes all AWS resources | All resources are destroyed |
| **7. Infrastructure Recreation** | Rebuilds infrastructure | New infrastructure is ready |
| **8. Backup Restoration** | Restores from backup | Application is restored |
| **9. Verification** | Confirms data integrity | Proof file exists and DB connects |
| **10. Final Cleanup** | Removes test resources | No orphaned resources remain |

### **Monitoring Stack Test Details**

The monitoring stack test (Step 5) validates that the optional monitoring components can be properly installed and uninstalled without affecting the core OpenEMR functionality. This test:

- **Installs the complete monitoring stack** including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Jaeger
- **Verifies all monitoring components** are running and accessible
- **Tests monitoring functionality** to ensure metrics collection and visualization work
- **Uninstalls the monitoring stack** cleanly without leaving orphaned resources
- **Validates cleanup** to ensure no monitoring pods or resources remain

This step ensures that the monitoring stack integration is robust and doesn't interfere with the core backup/restore process, while also validating that the monitoring components themselves work correctly.

## ‚úÖ Test Requirements

### **Success Criteria**

- **All 10 test steps must pass**: No exceptions or partial failures allowed
- **Complete infrastructure cycle**: Test must validate full create/destroy/restore cycle
- **Data integrity verification**: Proof files must be correctly restored
- **Connectivity validation**: Database and application connectivity must work after restore
- **Resource cleanup**: All test resources must be properly cleaned up

### **Performance Requirements**

- **Test duration**: 2-4 hours depending on infrastructure size
- **Resource usage**: AWS resources will be created and destroyed during testing
- **Cleanup verification**: No orphaned AWS resources after test completion

### **Validation Requirements**

- **Infrastructure health**: All AWS resources must be in healthy state
- **Application functionality**: OpenEMR must be fully operational
- **Data persistence**: Test data must survive the backup/restore cycle
- **Network connectivity**: All services must communicate correctly

## üîó Integration with Development Workflows

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Developer Warning**: The end-to-end test script (`scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh`) automatically resets all Kubernetes manifests to their default state using `restore-defaults.sh --force`. If you have uncommitted changes to Kubernetes manifests in the `k8s/` directory, **commit or stash your changes** before running the test script to avoid losing your work.

### **Before Any Changes**

```bash
# 1. Run end-to-end test
./scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh --cluster-name openemr-eks-test

# 2. Verify all steps pass
# 3. Proceed with changes only if test is successful
```

### **Release Process Integration**

```bash
# Manual release workflow
# 1. Run end-to-end test
./scripts/test-end-to-end-backup-restore.sh --cluster-name openemr-eks-test

# 2. Verify test passes
# 3. Create GitHub release
# 4. Include test results in release notes
```

## ‚ùå Failure Handling

### **Test Failure Response**

- **Immediate halt**: Stop all development work until test passes
- **Issue investigation**: Identify and document the root cause
- **Fix implementation**: Apply necessary fixes to resolve the issue
- **Re-test required**: Run complete test again after fixes
- **No exceptions**: This testing is mandatory for all workflows

### **Common Failure Scenarios**

| Failure Type | Common Causes | Resolution |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Infrastructure Deployment** | Terraform configuration errors | Fix configuration and re-test |

### **Escalation Process**

1. **Developer investigation**: Initial troubleshooting and fixes
2. **Team review**: Code review and configuration validation
3. **Infrastructure validation**: Verify Terraform and Kubernetes configurations
4. **External support**: Engage AWS support if needed
5. **Documentation**: Document all issues and resolutions
